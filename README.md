# AI Q&A Bot
AI-powered Q&amp;A chatbot built step by step using Hugging Face Transformers. Evolves from a basic terminal bot to a document-based study assistant.
This project shows my journey of building an AI-powered Q&A chatbot.

## 🚀 Phases
- **Phase 1:** Basic command-line chatbot (OpenAI → replaced with Hugging Face later).
- **Phase 2:** Added colors, history, error handling.
- **Phase 3:** Hugging Face version (free, open-source).
- **Phase 4:** Document-based Q&A (ask questions from PDF, DOCX, TXT).
- **Phase 5 (Upcoming):** GUI app with Streamlit.

## 🛠️ How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python qa_bot_doc.py

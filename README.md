# AI Q&A Bot
A chatbot built step by step using Hugging Face Transformers. Evolves from a basic terminal bot to a document-based study assistant.
This project shows my journey of building an AI-powered Q&A chatbot.

## 🚀 Phases
- **Phase 1:** Basic command-line chatbot.
- **Phase 2:** Document-based Q&A (ask questions from PDF, DOCX, TXT).
- **Phase 3:** GUI app with Streamlit.

## 🛠️ How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python qa_bot_doc.py
